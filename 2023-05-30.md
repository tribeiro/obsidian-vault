# Accomplished today

* Today it was mostly catching up after last week AOS workshop and AT run. So closing some open PRs, doing some reviews and getting stuff merged.
* Did some work on the Laser Tracker. I managed to get the CSC connected to the controller, and they seem to be communicating well. I tried to execute a couple measurements but didn't go very far. Furthermore, I think the controller might be missing some configurations, but I got distracted with meetings and wrapping up work from the AT run and didn't manage to make a lot more progress with it.


# Objectives for tomorrow

* Open a ticket for Petr to handle a new event we included in the Laser Tracker.
* Make my TR for the workshop in Seattle. 
* Fill my TER to get reimbursed for the ticket to Chile.
* Maybe do some additional work on the Laser Tracker?
* I think I am going to get started in [DM-39190](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-39190 "View this issue"), adding tolerance for missing acks in the pointing component. We have been experiencing a rate of 1 failure per night with this, which is annoying.
* Review Te Wei's PR in ts_aos_utils.
