# Acomplished today

* [#DM-37978](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-37978):
	* In the end I think the issues reported by Craig was due to the use of the wrong version of the package.
	   I tried to reproduce the error and couldn't.
	* I also could not reproduce the error with the source finding algorithm I tried to search for the OBS tickets describing it but couldn't find them. 
	* In the end I improved the error message when there's a timeout error and update the log messages in the monitor loop to resemble that of the main telescope, as requested by Ionana some time ago. 
* In addition to working in this ticket I spent some time reviewing PRs from Bruno, Guillem and Erik in #ts_observatory_control, #ts_externalscripts and #ts_standardscripts.
* I reviewed Tony's PR in #obs-controls, which documents how to upgrade the camera system.
* I also closed revision 4 early on during the day.
* Prepared agenda for PO meeting on Wednesday.

# Objectives for tomorrow

* Review [#DM-38026](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-38026) for Wouter. I plan to get to this one early in the morning. 
* I still need to finish the reviews for Bruno, Guillem and Erik as they are not done yet. 
* Tomorrow I have a higher load of meetings than today. There's CAP and the Data Reduction and Planning meeting in the later morning. In the afternoon I have a meeting with Erik to talk about handling dithering in the Scheduler.
* My sprint is kind of underplanned and I don't have any tasks asigned to work on. Some options are:
	* I could either start working in implementing the block commands in the Scheduler
	* Some documentation work. I want to get the documentation on using the development container up and running alongside things like, how to get started with developing CSCs etc. Some of it are in confluence right now so getting that into the tssw develop page would be good.
	* Pointing component. Russell asked me to stop sending track demands if the pointing goes to FAULT. I could work in implementing this feature and I need to get the current open branch merged to develop and release. It is accumulating quite a number of different features already.
	* Kafka service in the Jenkins server. It would be good to start experimenting with providing kafka for CI in our jenkins server.
