# Acomplished today

* Spent most of the day investigating an issue with the pointing model conversion of RA/Dec -> Alt/Az. Craig noticed that the offsets shown in the RubinTV table (computed by the rapid analysis framework) is still showing huge offsets with respect to the values computed by astrometry.net. We would expect that these values would be more consistent at this point but they are still not. As part of trying to figure out what is going on we were looking into the self consistency of the values returned by the pointing, using the mountPosition event, and we realized that the values doesn't match. This event has all the information required to convert from RaDec -> AltAz so they should match. And they don't. After spending a lot of time trying to find something, I wrote an e-mail to the pointing vendors asking for help. 
  
  After this started looking into implementing the feature that Russell requested, for the pointing to stop sending track command (and go to FAULT) if the MTMount/MTRotator rejects a track target command.
  
  I also started looking into the coordinate frame problem reported by Michael. That will require an xml change to get fixed. I made the PRs in ts_xml and ts_idl but the code change will have to wait.

# Objectives for tomorrow

* For tomorrow I will probably continue working on the pointing, trying to figure out what is going on with the coordinate conversion. There are some things I can still do even if I don't get any feedback from the pointing vendors. I will also test the changes I've made to the pointing component and try to get a PR in to merge and release these.
