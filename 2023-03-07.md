# Acomplished today

* The only productive thing I did today was review Wouter's PR with the ts-ess-common documentation on how to add new sensors.
* Did quick back and forth with Gillem on his PR in #ts_externalscripts.
* Other than that the day was filled up with back to back meetings.
	* After Standup meeting there was a meeting to discuss the summit IT maintainence and Software upgrades schedules. This was triggered by [last week's incident](https://lsstc.slack.com/archives/C2QFVCGLV/p1677770683489459) in which Kevin Reil issued a "no go" to summit updates due to TMA testing. Meeting notes can be found [here](https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/x/w5HDD).
	* After that was the weekly CAP meeting,
	* followed by the Data Reduction and Planning Meeting.
	* After that I had a quick meeting with Eric Dennehy to go over the dithering detailers and we also discussed some other items related to Scheduler configurations.
* After this I was left with almost no time to do anything productive so I did a quick PR in [observatory-controls-docs](https://github.com/lsst-ts/observatory-controls-docs) to update the documentation about writting SAL Scripts.
* I also started looking into the pointing component work I was planning on starting today, but didn't went very far in it.

# Objectives for tomorrow

* I think my main objective for tomorrow will be to work on the pointing component. I want to get the feature that Russell requested that makes the pointing go to FAULT and stop sending demands if the TMA rejects a track command ([DM-37137](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-37137)).  I also want to work in [DM-35122](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-35122).
