# Acomplished today

* As I had predicted, today was mostly getting things rebuilt for the AT run this week. There was an issue with the script queue build that I had to solve and I took the opportunity to make some changes that will make moving to the shared environment more straightforward and speedup the build.

# Objectives for tomorrow

* Tomorrow I expect to spend most of the time working with the pointing component.
