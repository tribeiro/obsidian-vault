# Acomplished today

* Today was pretty much all debugging pointing model. In the end I think I managed to figure out how to make the sky coordinates be correct. I need to cleanup the git history and open a PR to merge these changes. I still need to decide what to do in terms of testing for the pointing component now that the SAL doesn't support python anymore. 

# Objectives for tomorrow

* Tomorrow I'll support the AuxTel AOS run. During the day I need to make sure I rebuild the script queue containers with the latest version of the softwares available and need to make sure we have all the configurations ready to go for the night. 
* I doubt I will have some time for this but I was hoping to do some work in the Rust version of salobj.
