# Acomplished today

* Spent most of the time debugging and issue that appeared in the TMA observations on the night before. We observed a jump in the elevation offset of the pointing. This lasted between two faults and afected several observations. Issue is being tracked in OBS-111.
* After getting enough information about OBS-111 I did some work for the laser tracker. I got it deployed at the summit and started looking into the CSC connectivity with T2SA.

# Objectives for tomorrow

* I will probably dedicate most of the time to laser tracker. I want to develop some scripts we can use to test the CSC in Chile with the hardware mounted on M1M3.
* Will probably have to dedicate some time to looking at the MT data taken during the night and any issue reported during the AT run.
