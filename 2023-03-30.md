# Acomplished Today

* Was mostly wrapping up the updates I made to the pointing component. I managed to restore the orignal tests written by observatory sciences using robot framework and today was mostly reorganizing the commits and cleaning up some of the code.

# Objectives for tomorrow

* I need to take a look at the laser tracker. Not sure if the the LT hadware is still powered up at the summit but, if it is, I will try to connect to it using the CSC and doing some tests.
* The priority after LT is to work on the Scheduler ([DM-38324](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-38324 "View this issue")).
* I got some feedback in the PR I opened in astropy to fix an issue we have on our environment. I may take a look at that and see if I can get that merged soon.
