# Accomplished today

* Started the day closing cycle 30 revision 3, resetting the observing environment at the summit and TTS and setting up the environment on BTS.
* Had a long meeting with Sandrine.
* Patrick's farewell lunch, followed by a meeting with Merlin.
* Helped folks at the summit doing some TMA testing.
* Remove Weather Station from ts-xml.
* Finally got to run some tests with the Laser Tracker, until Spacial Analyzer crashed, at which point I decided to call it a day.

# Objectives for tomorrow

* I have a really meeting heavy day tomorrow. Priorities will revolve around:
	* Review Te Wei's PR in ts_aos_utils.
	* Laser Tracker.
	* Make my TR for the workshop in Seattle. 
	* Fill my TER to get reimbursed for the ticket to Chile.
	* I think I am going to get started in [DM-39190](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-39190 "View this issue"), adding tolerance for missing acks in the pointing component. We have been experiencing a rate of 1 failure per night with this, which is annoying.
