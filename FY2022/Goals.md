>Please comment on how you supported Rubin Construction during FY22.Â  Please include major milestones achieved and detail how you contributed.

I have contributed to several aspects of the Rubin Construction during FY22, mostly related to software integration, testing and development for both the Main and Auxiliary Telescopes.
I have also actively participated in several commissioning activities and dedicated substantial efforts in documentation and training of new personnel.

The following is a collection of some noteworthy activities I have contributed to:

* Maintenance, Development and Support for the build and deployment system.

	This is probably one of the core services Telescope and Site is developing for the Observatory Control System.
	A modern agile software system requires an agile build and deployment system.
	The current "cycle build" system was introduced in Mid-2020 and has now matured to the point where it is seamless integrated to the day-to-day operation of the observatory.
	During FY22 we expanded the documentation for this system, trained new personnel to interact with it and continued to improve the system based on our growing experience.
	
	In the period between October/2021 and September/2022 we deployed 5 new cycles (e.g. different versions of the system) with 45 revisions total (average of 9 revisions per cycle).

* Scheduler CSC development and on-sky testing.
  
	One of the main components I am in charge of development is the Scheduler CSC.
	During FY22, we saw an increase in the use of the Scheduler CSC for nighttime operations of the Auxiliary Telescope, which gave us the opportunity to test the component early on in preparation for Main Telescope operations.
	
	Initially, the focus of operations with the Auxiliary Telescope was to get the entire system to an operational state.
	Later, with the Scheduler operating more regularly, we switched focus to training personnel for operating the component as well as configuring the component to execute different survey operations.
	These two complimentary training activities target different audiences (observers at the summit vs astronomers interested in implementing different observations strategies) and require different types of material and exercises.
	
	Operation-type documentation was mainly included in the obs-ops page, for which I contributed substantially. 
	
	One thing we realized in operating with the Scheduler is that it is extremely efficient to conduct observations.
	
	P.S.: It is worth noting that, at the time of this writing, we have just successfully driven the Main Telescope with the Scheduler. Even though we are now in FY23, I thought it was worth mentioning as it is a major milestone.

* System-wide Integration Testing.
  
	Previously known as "Level 3 testing", this was a major activity that occupied a good portion of FY22.
	We took advantage of having the majority of the Main Telescope software components available on "Level 3" (the 3rd floor of the Main Telescope building) to conduct a series of integration tests.
	
	These activities proved to be extremely fruitful, both in getting the software tested and in training personnel to interact with the system.

* Training and Documentation efforts.
	
	Even though I have mentioned "documentation" and "training" in practically every one of the previous items, I think this subject deserves an item on itself.
	
	One of my main goals for FY22 was to considerably improve operations documentation and train other members of the team such that we would be able to rely less on my intervention.
	In additional to writing a substantial amount of documentation myself, I also helped other members to write documentation themselves.
	The documentation ecosystem has grown considerably during FY22, with contributions for several other members of the team.
	Furthermore, by the end of FY22 it was no longer required for me to be constantly accompanying the observing runs with the Auxiliary Telescope and/or testing with the Main Telescope which, to me, is a strong indication that I was successful in my original goal.
