FY22 was a challenging and exciting year. We saw the Scheduler taking on a central role in driving the observations with the Auxiliary Telescope, as well as integration testing with the Simonyi Telescope components ramping up in the level 3. We managed to do a lot of progress with the system in preparation for assembly of the telescope and testing of on TMA.

I am confident that my contributions to the project continue to be significant. While I have directly contributed to many aread to the project, I believe that my most valuable contributions have been through the creation of documentation and training resources that have enabled other team members to work efficiently and effectively with the system. By sharing my knowledge and expertise, I have helped to build a culture of collaboration and support that has strengthened the team's capabilities and overall success.
