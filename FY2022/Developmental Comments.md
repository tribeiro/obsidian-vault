One of my developmental goals for FY22 was to evaluate technology trends and the future of the observatory control software. This goal already generated outcomes as we studied Kafka as a replacement for DDS as the control system middleware. I have also been learning new modern programming languages that we could potentially adopt in the future to improve and modernize the control system. 

I am confident that the documentation practices I have established have become a valuable asset to the project as a whole. Through a consistent and comprehensive approach, I have been able to consolidate and streamline the documentation process, resulting in greater efficiency and accuracy. Overall, I am pleased with the outcome of these efforts and the positive impact they have had on the project.

In addition, I have invested significant time and effort in training my colleagues to perform tasks that were previously only within my domain. This not only enabled me to delegate more effectively, but also helped to mitigate risks associated with being a single point of failure. Through these training efforts, I have empowered my colleagues to take on more responsibility and contribute to the project's success. I am pleased with the results of these efforts and look forward to continuing to support my colleagues in their development.

Looking ahead to FY23, I remain committed to identifying and evaluating emerging technology and process trends that could enhance our team's efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, I plan to continue my documentation and training efforts, which have proven to be invaluable in facilitating the onboarding of new team members and reducing the risk associated with being a single point of failure for critical activities. By sharing my knowledge and expertise, I aim to enable my colleagues to work more independently and confidently, ultimately contributing to the overall success of the project.
