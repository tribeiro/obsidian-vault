# Acting with integrity

I continue to try my best to act with integrity and ethics and to be respectful and civil towards my colleagues and collaborators.

I worked to set good examples and to demonstrate that I am a trustworthy and dependable colleague. I made sure to be honest and to adhere to the project values and standards.  

Overall, I am pleased with my performance in this area and I will continue to strive to maintain a high level of professional conduct.

# Decision Making

At this point I think I am a lot more confortable in my position in the project. During FY22 I continued to explore different ways my decision making process could be improved. I am confident that I have achieved a good level of understanding of my roles and how to collaborate with my colleagues to achieve solutions to problems that are effective and satisfactory.

# Personal and institutional growth

During FY22 I continue to look for feedback from my colleagues on improvements we can do to the Observatory Control System to make their lives easier. I have also dedicated substantial effort in writing documentation and helping other familiarize with our documentation framework so they could also contribute.

In terms of personal growth for FY22 I dedicated some time to learn new programming languages. There's a new programming language called Rust which is quite prominent in industry right now, which I studied and started to use on some small projects. I noticed that there is a growing interest in Rust in the astronomical community (including in Rubin's community) and I believe we might see some code written in Rust in the project soon.

I also dedicated some time to learning Kafka, which we plan to replace DDS with in FY23. 

In terms of institutional growth, I advocated with my manager for a better definition of my role going into operations, which I think is important not only for me but also for the project.

# Responsibility and Accountability

Like in previous years, FY22 was a challenging time to manage the balance between the different tasks I am working on. Especially with my involvement in the Simonyi Telescope commissioning in level 3 and the Auxiliary Telescope observations, it was difficult to keep up with the demands of both.

I was able to effectively manage this balance by taking a step back and reassessing my priorities, with help from my colleagues. They help me identify the most important tasks and focused the majority of my time and energy on them. Whenever possible I would tried to delegate tasks to other members of the team. 

Overall, I believe I was able to effectively manage the balance between the different tasks I was working on in FY22.

# Safety 

Safety of people and equipment continue to be one of my top priorities in any work I am involved in the project. During FY22 I was involved in a couple safety incidents, none with victims, and I made sure to report these events to my manager. Also, while working in restructuring the operation documentation I advocated for the "Safety" section to be placed at the top of the page, paying homage to the fact that we value safety first.

Ensuring the safety of people and equipment is always at the forefront of my priorities in any project I'm involved in. Throughout FY22, I encountered a few safety incidents, fortunately without any injuries or harm. However, I promptly reported these incidents to my manager to ensure that appropriate actions were taken to prevent future occurrences. Additionally, when restructuring the operation documentation, I strongly advocated for the "Safety" section to be prominently placed at the top of the page, highlighting the significance of prioritizing safety above all else.

# Support an inclusive and diverse environment

I strongly believe that building an inclusive and diverse work environment is an ongoing effort that requires commitment, support, and action from everyone in the organization. 

I always try to encourage open communication, and listen to and respect the ideas and opinions of those from different backgrounds and experiences. Although I am seldom able to participate in the inclusion activities promoted by the project I always try to review the materials, especially the TED talks and videos shared in "inclusion" slack channel., which helps broaden my views and perspectives about how to improve and support inclusion and diversity.
