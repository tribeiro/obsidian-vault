# Acomplished today

* Today was pretty much all day getting ready for the AuxTel run and then supporting the run. 

# Objectives for Monday

* Next week there will be an AuxTel. I need to get the Scheduler PRs reviewed, merged and then rebuild the Scheduler. 
* I also need to rebuild the Script Queue with the latest version of all the packages and get it redeployed.
* I doubt I'll have time to do anything else but if so, I'll start preparing a PR for the pointing component.
