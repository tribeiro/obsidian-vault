# Acomplished today

Today was mostly pointing component.
I analysed the data from the wide camera and then worked towards loading the new model (built with data from the narrow) at the summit.
In the meantime I was also working in adding some tests to the pointing component and before wrapping up the work I did in it.
I also spend some time helping folks debug some issues at the summit with AuxTel.
At the end of the day I was helping bring TTS up again and encountered some issues with the kafka producers.
I also had a tag up meeting with Sandrine and she asked me to dedicate some time to the Laser Tracker.
She wants to get this system past verification so we can use it as an example of how to do verification in a CI environment. 

# Objectives for tomorrow

* For tomorrow I am probably going to put a pause in the pointing component work and spend some time with the laser tracker.
   If Petr is able to work on the deployment at the summit I may work in writting some scripts to setup and drive the system so we can test it at the summit.
* Still, depending on how things goes I may also do one or two things in the pointing.
