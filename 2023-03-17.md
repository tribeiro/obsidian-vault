# Acomplished today

* I end up spending a good portion of the day going over the OBS tickets, tracking down duplicated tickets, marking tickets as done and pinging people about status. We need to find a better way to report these issues that does not involves creating new tickets every time a script fails. The majority of these issues we see now are not new and are already reported. 
* I also spent a lot of time answering questions on slack. People went to Chile for the JTM and came back with a lot of questions. 
	* I need to file tickets to update the Scheduler documentation. There's outdated information there, as well as duplicated things that needs to be consolidated in one place [DM-38382](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-38382 "DM-38382").
* I did some work in the pointing model but not a lot.
* I didn't do anything in the Laser Tracker that I was planning on doing. This will have to wait for next week unfortunately.

# Objectives for next day

* I need to make PRs for some changes I made in support of AT run.
	* https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_externalscripts/tree/tickets/DM-38260
* My main objectives will be Laser Tracker, need to make sure the CSC can talk to the Laser Controller. But this is mainly poking people around for help in Chile. In the meantime I need to start writting some Scripts to control it. I will start with the setup script. 
	* My impression from looking at this is that we might need some updates in the xml to properly support it. The laser is not reporting its full status so I may actually take some time to add any missing information to the Laser Tracker xml. But the focus will be the Scripts.
* Pointing component will continue to be a priority. I am pretty close be get the robot framework testing suite working again. Need to get that going then close the ticket I am working on.
* For next week I also need to do some work in the Scheduler, implementing [DM-38324](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-38324 "View this issue"). Not sure how feasible it will be though with the Laser Tracker creeping up in the priority.
