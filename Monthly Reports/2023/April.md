# Accomplishments this period

* With the summit down time to install the M1M3 cell on the TMA April was mostly dedicated to doing some cleanup in the codebase and getting personnel trained up in various aspects of the development procedures.
* I spent some time working on the pointing component changes made to improve integration with the MTMount and some other bug fixes.
* I also dedicated some time to work on the Scheduler, continuing implementing the observing block functionality.


# Objectives for next period

* For May we expect AuxTel run to resume so I will have to dedicate some time supporting that.
* There's also planned upgrades on the summit systems that I will be helping out, along with upgrades to TTS and bringing BTS up.
* I will continue working with other members of the commissioning team to get them trained up in developing SAL Scripts to execute engineering and other operation like activities.
