# Accomplishments this period

* A substantial part of the March was dedicated to supporting TMA verification tests. In addition to remote support for the nighttime activities, I was also working on the pointing component, implementing new features to improve interoperability with the MTMount component and analyzing pointing data to build pointing models.
* I also did some work with the LaserTracker, trying to get it to work at the summit. Even though we managed to make some progress, we were not able to connect the laser controller with the T2SA software to drive the system. We hope to be able to conclude this soon enough to allow us to perform measurements using the control system.
* As usual, I performed the routine software updates.
* I also supported the AuxTel runs that occurred during the month of March.
* I did some work in documentation, but mostly reorganizing the https://tssw-developer.lsst.io documentation page. Furthermore, I didn't manage to work on expanding the developer guides as I hoped.

# Objectives for next period

* For April, we will have wrapped up all the current cycle of TMA testing and there will be no AuxTel runs, to give the observers a rest on nighttime activities.
* I expect this month will be dedicated to continue implementation of the observing blocks functionality on the Scheduler, which had to be put on hold during March to support TMA testing.
* Continue work in documentation. During April, I hope I will be able to pick up where I left in the task of improving TSSW developer guides.
