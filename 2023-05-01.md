# Acomplished Today

* Implemented new method in ts_observatory_control to allow offseting the rotator. This will be usefull for the upcomming AT run.
* Continued working on the updating the Scheduler documentation. I also caught a small bug/improvements that needed to be done so I implemented that as well.

# Objectives for tomorrow

* Continue working with the Scheduler documentation. Hopefully I'll be able to close this out today. But I am considering doing a major revision of the documentation and potentially adding some missing information about blocks etc. So this might take a bit longer.
* Review PRs from other people on scripts.
* Need to get the Travel Request to Chile moving.
