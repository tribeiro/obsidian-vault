# Acomplished Today

* Did some work on the Laser Tracker. Managed to get the CSC connected to the T2SA software but the T2SA software cannot connect to the Laser Tracker controller. Handed it over to Dave to take a look at it.
* Looked at some of the PR comments I got on the pointing and astropy. Still need to do some work on astropy but looking ok. 
* Started working on the Scheduler.

# Objectives for tomorrow

* Look at astropy PR.
* Maybe some Laser Tracker. 
* Work on the Scheduler ([DM-38324](https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-38324 "View this issue")).
